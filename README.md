### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Project

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to (a) import the data, analyse it and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The csv files used in this project are:

washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv
